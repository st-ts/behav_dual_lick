# behavior_dual_lick
Set of programs to run the experiments with a dual-choice discrimination task with auditory cues. Depending on the tone (high or low) a mouse needs to lick left or right water port for a water reward (mice are water deprived)
The training goes through the following stages:
1. (A1) Introducing to the rewards from water port. Mouse is rewarded with water whenever it licks eaither of the 2 ports. A go cue sounds right before the water delivery
2. (A2) Introducing the association between the tones and the corresponding ports. At this stage, a mouse isn't punished for choosing a wrong port
3. (A3) Mouse has to lick the correct port after the go cue, if it licks the wrong port 1st, there is no reward and a timeout as a punishment
