# MATLAB scripts for dual lick task
Set of programs to run the experiments with a dual-choice discrimination task with auditory cues. Depending on the tone (high or low) a mouse needs to lick left or right water port for a water reward (mice are water-deprived)

## Stages of training:
1. (A1) Introducing to the rewards from water port. Mouse is rewarded with water whenever it licks eaither of the 2 ports. A go cue sounds right before the water delivery
2. (A2) Introducing the association between the tones and the corresponding ports. At this stage, a mouse isn't punished for choosing a wrong port
3. (A3) Mouse has to lick the correct port after the go cue, if it licks the wrong port 1st, there is no reward and a timeout as a punishment

## Experimental paradigm:
The task is adopted almost with no modifications from Guo et al 2014 paper [Procedures for Behavioral Experiments in Head-Fixed Mice](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088678#pone-0088678-g012)

## Background on mice:
* Cranial window over ALM, GCampXC in pyramidal neurons (CaMKII promoter)
* Opsin in the the part of the striatum receiving the projections from ALM
